	- Added flag to make_auth to specify the
	authentication type, plus string lengths (because
	in some auth types, the password string may contain NULs.
	- Added optional flag to ->authen() to specify the
	authentication type. Defaults to ASCII
	- Some reformatting to make it easier to read.
	- Cleaned up Makefiles so it builds cleaner
